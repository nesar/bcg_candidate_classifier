# Rank-Based Evaluation Implementation Summary

## What Changes You Should See

When you run `enhanced_full_run.py` now, you should see the following improvements:

### 1. **During Test Execution**
```
Evaluating probabilistic model on 404 test images...
Using rank-based evaluation (top-k candidate success tracking)...
```

### 2. **In Terminal Output** 
The evaluation report will now show both distance-based AND rank-based success rates:
```
Distance-based Success Rates:
  Within 10px: 67.3%
  Within 20px: 78.5%
  Within 30px: 84.2%
  Within 50px: 89.4%

Rank-based Success Rates:
  Best candidate (Rank 1): 67.3%
  Top-2 candidates (Rank ≤2): 73.8%  
  Top-3 candidates (Rank ≤3): 78.2%
  Top-5 candidates (Rank ≤5): 82.1%
  Mean rank: 2.34
  Median rank: 2.0
```

### 3. **In evaluation_results.csv**
A new column `bcg_rank` will appear showing the rank (1, 2, 3, etc.) where the true BCG appeared among candidates, or NaN if not found.

### 4. **In diagnostic_plots.png**
The top-left pie chart will now show:
- **Best Prediction (Rank 1)** - Green
- **2nd Best Prediction (Rank 2)** - Orange  
- **3rd Best Prediction (Rank 3)** - Dark Orange
- **Lower Rank (Rank >3)** - Purple
- **Not Detected** - Red

Title will show: "Rank-based Success Analysis" with "Top-3 Success: XX.X%"

### 5. **Improved Failure Cases**
Cases where the true BCG is the 2nd or 3rd best candidate will NO LONGER appear in failure plots, even if the distance error is large. Only true failures (not detected or very low rank) will be shown.

## Key Benefits

1. **More Accurate Assessment**: Recognizes that finding the true BCG as 2nd or 3rd candidate is still a success
2. **Better Failure Analysis**: Focuses on cases where the model truly failed to identify the correct region
3. **Actionable Insights**: Shows whether the model finds the right area but ranks it incorrectly
4. **Interactive Use Support**: Helps evaluate models for scenarios where users might examine multiple top candidates

## Implementation Details

- **Rank Calculation**: Uses 10-pixel distance threshold to match candidates with true BCG
- **Top-k Success**: Tracks success at ranks 1, 2, 3, and 5
- **Failure Redefinition**: Only considers true failures when BCG not detected OR (large error AND not in top-3)
- **CSV Integration**: All rank data saved for further analysis
- **Backward Compatibility**: Falls back to traditional distance-based analysis if rank data not available

The rank-based evaluation provides a more nuanced view of model performance, especially valuable for interactive applications where multiple top candidates might be examined.
